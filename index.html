  1. Describe your previous experience with coding
      1. What classes have you taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS?
      I've only been exposed to HTML/CSS/JS in my core interaction class last semester.
      2. What parts of the class resonated with you?
      I enjoyed having the creative freedom to code my own website, and design it however I liked.
      3. Which parts were the most confusing?
      Javascript, we barely learnt it as the Strike started as we were being introduced to Js.
  2. How are you feeling about learning to code in this class? Nervous? Excited?
  I'm excited and want to catch up on everything I couldn't learn last semester. 
  3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?
  I hope to be a UI/UX designer, and I know that coding will be handy.
  4. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Which one(s) are required to create a webpage?
A webpage can be made with just HTML, but CSS allows one to design it, while Js makes it more interactive.
Describe what GitHub does
Github acts as a server platform, so that files on our computer can be uploaded to the web and made into a public domain.</h5>
